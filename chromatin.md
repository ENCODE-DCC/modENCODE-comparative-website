abstract: Genome function is dynamically regulated in part by chromatin, which consists of the histones, non-histone proteins and RNA molecules that package DNA. Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have contributed notably to our understanding of molecular mechanisms of genome function in humans, and have revealed conservation of chromatin components and mechanisms. Nevertheless, the three organisms have markedly different genome sizes, chromosome architecture and gene organization. On human and fly chromosomes, for example, pericentric heterochromatin flanks single centromeres, whereas worm chromosomes have dispersed heterochromatin-like regions enriched in the distal chromosomal ‘arms’, and centromeres distributed along their lengths. To systematically investigate chromatin organization and associated gene regulation across species, we generated and analysed a large collection of genome-wide chromatin data sets from cell lines and developmental stages in worm, fly and human. Here we present over 800 newdata sets from our ENCODE and modENCODE consortia, bringing the total to over 1,400. Comparison of combinatorial patterns of histone modifications, nuclear lamina-associated domains, the organization of large-scale topological domains, the chromatin environment at promoters and enhancers, nucleosome positioning, and DNA replication patterns reveals many conserved features of chromatin organization among the three organisms. We also find notable differences in the composition and locations of repressive chromatin. These data sets and analyses provide a rich resource for comparative and species-specific investigations of chromatin composition, organization and function.

<h2>Overall Description</h2>
<br>The datasets were generated by the modENCODE (model organism Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and ENCODE consortia in 2007-2012, funded by National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). Please see <a href="http://www.genome.gov/26524507">http://www.genome.gov/26524507</a> and <a href="http://www.genome.gov/Encode/">http://www.genome.gov/Encode/</a> for more information about the project.<br>
<br>
These data consist of ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip profiles for histone modifications and chromosomal proteins in fly, worm, and human, as well as several related data sets. The ChIP-chip datasets were produced on Affymetrix (fly) or NimbleGen (worm) arrays. The ChIP-seq datasets were generated on the Illumina sequencers.<br>

<p><strong><a href="http://encode-x.med.harvard.edu/">ENCODE-X Browser</a></strong>: We have developed web application for theses chromatin datasets. The main advantage of our web application is that it will allow one to quick see what chromatin-related data are available using faceted browsing and use the IGV browser to view the data, for all three organisms. The chromatin state maps generated in Ho et al, 2014 are automatically loaded in the encode-x browser. </p>

<div id="Input normalized ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip fold enrichment profiles">
  <h2>Input normalized ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip fold enrichment profiles</h2>
 <h4>ChIP-seq</h4>
 <p>To enable the cross-species comparisons described in this paper, we have reprocessed all data using MACS. (Due to the slight differences in the peak-calling and input normalization steps, there may be slight discrepancies between the fly profiles analyzed here
and profiles available at <a href="http://data.modencode.org">the modENCODE data portal</a> or <a href="http://modmine.org">modMine</a>. <br><br>
For every pair of aligned ChIP and matching input-DNA data, we used MACS version 2 to generate fold enrichment signal tracks for every position in a genome:<br>
<i>macs2 callpeak -t ChIP.bam -c Input.bam -B --nomodel --shiftsize 73 --SPMR -g hs -n ChIP</i><br>
<i>macs2 bdgcmp -t ChIP_treat_pileup.bdg -c ChIP_control_lambda.bdg -o ChIP_FE.bedgraph -m FE</i><br>
</p>
<h4>ChIP-chip</h4>
<p>For the fly data, genomic DNA Tiling Arrays v2.0 (Affymetrix) were used to hybridize ChIP
and input DNA. We obtained the log-intensity ratio values (M-values) for all perfect match
(PM) probes: M = log2(ChIP intensity) - log2(input intensity), and performed a whole-genome
baseline shift so that the mean of M in each microarray is equal to 0. The smoothed log intensity
ratios were calculated using LOWESS with a smoothing span corresponding to 500 bp,
combining normalized data from two replicate experiments. For the worm data, a custom
Nimblegen two-channel whole genome microarray platform was used to hybridize both ChIP
and input DNA. MA2C was used to preprocess the data to obtain a normalized and median
centered log2 ratio for each probe. All data are publicly accessible through the modENCODE
data portal or modMine.
<br>
The input normalized profiles are availabe at <a href="http://encode-x.med.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">ENCODE-X browser</a>.

   <h2>DNase-seq data</h2>
   <p>Aligned DNase-seq data were downloaded from the modENCODE data portal and the <a href="http://encodeproject.org/ENCODE/" target="_blank">ENCODE UCSC download page</a>. Additional Drosophila embryo DNase-seq data were downloaded. 
   After confirming consistency, reads from biological replicates were merged. We calculated minimally-smoothed signals (by a Gaussian
kernel smoother with bandwidth of 10 bp in fly and 50 bp in human) along the genome in 10 bp
(fly) or 50 bp (human) non-overlapping bins.

   <br>

   <h2>MNase-seq data</h2>
   <p>The MNase-seq data were analyzed as described previously38. In brief, tags were mapped to the
corresponding reference genome assemblies. The positions at which the number of mapped tags
had a Z-score > 7 were considered anomalous due to potential amplification bias. The tags
mapped to such positions were discarded. To compute profiles of nucleosomal frequency
around TSS, the centers of the fragments were used in the case of paired-end data. In the case of
single-end data, tag positions were shifted by the half of the estimated fragment size (estimated
using cross-correlation analysis39 toward the fragment 3�-ends and tags mapping to positive and
negative DNA strands were combined). Loess smoothing in the 11-bp window, which does not
affect positions of the major minima and maxima on the plots, was applied to reduce the highfrequency
noise in the profiles.

   <h2>GC-content</h2>

   We downloaded the 5bp GC% data from the UCSC genome browser annotation download page (<a href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html" target="_blank">http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html</a>) for

   </ul>
   Centering at every 5 bp bin, we calculated the running median of the GC% of the surrounding 100 bp (i.e., 105 bp in total). GC scores were then binned into 10 bp (fly and worm) or 50 bp (human) non-overlapping bins.
