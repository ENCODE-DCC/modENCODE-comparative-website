abstract: Genome function is dynamically regulated in part by chromatin, which consists of the histones, non-histone proteins and RNA molecules that package DNA. Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have contributed notably to our understanding of molecular mechanisms of genome function in humans, and have revealed conservation of chromatin components and mechanisms. Nevertheless, the three organisms have markedly different genome sizes, chromosome architecture and gene organization. On human and fly chromosomes, for example, pericentric heterochromatin flanks single centromeres, whereas worm chromosomes have dispersed heterochromatin-like regions enriched in the distal chromosomal ‘arms’, and centromeres distributed along their lengths. To systematically investigate chromatin organization and associated gene regulation across species, we generated and analysed a large collection of genome-wide chromatin data sets from cell lines and developmental stages in worm, fly and human. Here we present over 800 newdata sets from our ENCODE and modENCODE consortia, bringing the total to over 1,400. Comparison of combinatorial patterns of histone modifications, nuclear lamina-associated domains, the organization of large-scale topological domains, the chromatin environment at promoters and enhancers, nucleosome positioning, and DNA replication patterns reveals many conserved features of chromatin organization among the three organisms. We also find notable differences in the composition and locations of repressive chromatin. These data sets and analyses provide a rich resource for comparative and species-specific investigations of chromatin composition, organization and function.

## Overall Description

The datasets were generated by the modENCODE (model organism Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and ENCODE consortia in 2007-2012, funded by National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). Please see [http://www.genome.gov/26524507](http://www.genome.gov/26524507) and [http://www.genome.gov/Encode/](http://www.genome.gov/Encode/) for more information about the projects.

These data consist of ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip profiles for histone modifications and chromosomal proteins in fly, worm, and human, as well as several related data sets. The ChIP-chip datasets were produced on Affymetrix (fly) or NimbleGen (worm) arrays. The ChIP-seq datasets were generated on the Illumina sequencers.

### ChIP-seq

To enable the cross-species comparisons described in this paper, we have reprocessed all data using MACS. (Due to the slight differences in the peak-calling and input normalization steps, there may be slight discrepancies between the fly profiles analyzed here and profiles available at [modENCODE data portal](http://data.modencode.org) or [modMine](http://modmine.org)). 

For every pair of aligned ChIP and matching input-DNA data, we used MACS version 2 to generate fold enrichment signal tracks for every position in a genome:

```
macs2 callpeak -t ChIP.bam -c Input.bam -B --nomodel --shiftsize 73 --SPMR -g hs -n ChIP

macs2 bdgcmp -t ChIP_treat_pileup.bdg -c ChIP_control_lambda.bdg -o ChIP_FE.bedgraph -m FE
```

### ChIP-chip

For the fly data, genomic DNA Tiling Arrays v2.0 (Affymetrix) were used to hybridize ChIP and input DNA. We obtained the log-intensity ratio values (M-values) for all perfect match (PM) probes: M = log2(ChIP intensity) - log2(input intensity), and performed a whole-genome baseline shift so that the mean of M in each microarray is equal to 0. The smoothed log intensity ratios were calculated using LOWESS with a smoothing span corresponding to 500 bp, combining normalized data from two replicate experiments. For the worm data, a custom Nimblegen two-channel whole genome microarray platform was used to hybridize both ChIP and input DNA. MA2C was used to preprocess the data to obtain a normalized and median centered log2 ratio for each probe. All data are publicly accessible through the modENCODE data portal or modMine.

The input normalized profiles are availabe at [ENCODE-X Browser](http://encode-x.med.harvard.edu/).

### DNase-seq data

Aligned DNase-seq data were downloaded from the modENCODE data portal and the [ENCODE UCSC download page](http://encodeproject.org/ENCODE/). Additional Drosophila embryo DNase-seq data were downloaded. After confirming consistency, reads from biological replicates were merged. We calculated minimally-smoothed signals (by a Gaussian kernel smoother with bandwidth of 10 bp in fly and 50 bp in human) along the genome in 10 bp (fly) or 50 bp (human) non-overlapping bins.

### MNase-seq data

The MNase-seq data were analyzed as described in [Tolstorukov _et al._, "Histone variant H2A.Bbd is associated with active transcription and mRNA processing in human cells", Molecular Cell (2012)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3708478). In brief, tags were mapped to the corresponding reference genome assemblies. The positions at which the number of mapped tags had a Z-score > 7 were considered anomalous due to potential amplification bias. The tags mapped to such positions were discarded. To compute profiles of nucleosomal frequency around TSS, the centers of the fragments were used in the case of paired-end data. In the case of single-end data, tag positions were shifted by the half of the estimated fragment size (estimated using cross-correlation analysis toward the fragment 3'-ends and tags mapping to positive and negative DNA strands were combined). Loess smoothing in the 11-bp window, which does not affect positions of the major minima and maxima on the plots, was applied to reduce the high-frequency noise in the profiles.


## <a name="GC-content"></a> GC-content

We downloaded the 5bp GC% data from the UCSC genome browser annotation download page ([http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html)) for:

*   [human (hg19) [~1.5GB]](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/gc5Base/hg19.gc5Base.txt.gz)
*   [fly (dm3) [~670KB]](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm3/database/gc5Base.txt.gz)
*   [worm (ce10) [~54MB]](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/gbdb/ce10/bbi/gc5Base.bw) (in bigWig format, need to convert into wig using the [bigwig2wig](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe) program)

Centering at every 5 bp bin, we calculated the running median of the GC% of the surrounding 100 bp (i.e., 105 bp in total). GC scores were then binned into 10 bp (fly and worm) or 50 bp (human) non-overlapping bins.


## <a name="PhastCons scores"></a> PhastCons scores

PhastCons scores were then binned into 10 bp (fly and worm) or 50 bp (human) non-overlapping bins.

*   [human (hg19)](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/phastCons46way/vertebrate/)
*   [fly (dm3) ](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm3/phastCons15way/)
*   [worm (ce10)](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/ce10/phastCons7way/)

## <a name="Genomic sequence mappability tracks"></a> Genomic sequence mappability tracks

We generated empirial genomic sequence mappability tracks using input-DNA sequencing data. After merging input reads up to 100M, reads were extended to 149 bp which corresponds to the shift of 74 bp in signal tracks. The union set of empirically mapped regions was obtained. They are available here:

*   [human (hg19)](http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/modencode/webpage/mappability/mappability.hg19.wig.tdf)
*   [fly (dm3)](http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/modencode/webpage/mappability/mappability.dm3.wig.tdf)
*   [worm (ce10) ](http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/modencode/webpage/mappability/mappability.ce10.wig.tdf)

## <a name="Coordinates of unassembled genomic sequences"></a>Coordinates of unassembled genomic sequences

We downloaded the "Gap" table from the UCSC genome browser download page ([http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html)):

*   [human (hg19)](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/gap.txt.gz)
*   [fly (dm3)](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm3/database/) (search for chr*_gap.txt.gz)

There are no known unassembled regions in worm.

## <a name="Worm TSS definition based on capRNA-seq (capTSS)"></a> Worm TSS definition based on capRNA-seq (capTSS)

We obtained worm TSS definition based on capRNA-seq from [Chen et al. "The landscape of RNA polymerase II transcription initiation in C. elegans reveals promoter and enhancer architectures"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23550086).

Briefly, short 5'-capped RNA from total nuclear RNA of mixed stage embryos were sequenced (i.e., capRNA- seq) by Illumina GAIIA (SE36) with two biological replicates. [Reads](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE42819) from capRNA-seq were mapped to WS220 reference genome using BWA. [Transcription initiation regions (TICs)](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/suppl/2013/04/16/gr.153668.112.DC1/Supp_TableS2.xls) were identified by clustering of capRNA-seq reads. In this analysis we used TICs that overlap with wormbase TSSs within -199:100bp. We refer these capRNA-seq defined TSSs as capTSS in this study.

## <a name="Hi-C defined topological domains"></a> Hi-C defined topological domains

The data were downloaded from  [Dixon _et al._, "Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by
analysis of chromatin interactions", Nature (2012)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356448) and [Sexton _et al._, "Three-dimensional folding and functional organization principles of the Drosophila genome", Cell (2012)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867412000165). Here are the genomic coordinates used in our study:
