abstract: Despite the extremely large evolutionary distances separating metazoan species, they show remarkable commonalities, which has helped establish fly and worm as model organisms for human biology. Although studies of individual elements and factors have explored similarities in gene regulation, a large scale comparative analysis of basic principles of transcriptional regulatory features is lacking. To address this lack we mapped the genome-wide binding locations of 165 human, 93 worm, and 52 fly transcription-regulatory factors (RFs) generating a total of 1,019 data sets from a variety of cell-types, developmental stages, or conditions in the three species, of which 498 are presented here for the first time. We find that structural properties of regulatory networks are remarkably conserved, including clustering of RFs in high-occupancy target (HOT) regions, differential chromatin signatures associated with context specific vs. constitutive HOT regions, and the relative frequency of network motifs. Moreover, orthologous RF families recognize similar binding motifs in vivo and show some similar co-associations, despite dramatic divergence in their specific regulatory targets. Our results suggest that gene-regulatory properties previously observed for individual factors are in fact general principles of metazoan regulation that are remarkably well-preserved despite extensive functional divergence of individual network connections. The comparative maps of regulatory circuitry provided here will be crucial in understanding the regulatory underpinnings of model organism biology and how these relate to human biology, development, and disease.
